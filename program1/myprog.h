                  Here Scott has set the maximum number of possible legal moves to be 48.
                                  Be forewarned that this number might not be correct, even though I'm
                                  pretty sure it is.  
                  The second array subscript is (supposed to be) the maximum number of 
                  squares that a piece could visit in a single move.  This number is arrived
                  at be recognizing that an opponent will have at most 12 pieces on the 
                  board, and so you can at most jump twelve times.  However, the number
                  really ought to be 13 since we also have to record the starting position
                  as part of the move sequence.  I didn't code this, and I highly doubt 
                  that the natural course of a game would lead to a person jumping all twelve
                  of an opponents checkers in a single move, so I'm not going to change this. 
                  I'll leave it to the adventuresome to try and devise a way to legally generate
                  a board position that would allow such an event.  
                  Each move is represented by a sequence of numbers, the first number being 
                  the starting position of the piece to be moved, and the rest being the squares 
                  that the piece will visit (in order) during the course of a single move.  The 
                  last number in this sequence is the final position of the piece being moved.  */
